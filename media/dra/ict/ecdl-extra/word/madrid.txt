incredible past. Once an Arabian Fortress, this city is now a thriving cultural centre bursting with 
monuments, galleries and museums. You will even see Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, home of the famous 
Real Madrid football team.

Artistic Madrid
Introducing one of the world's greatest art galleries. The Prado Museum holds major works from all the great 
schools of European art, including paintings by Rubens, Rafael, Goya and El Greco. Let our guides take you 
there. Then move on to explore the 18th-century Royal Palace.

Toledo, El Escorial, Valley of the Fallen
Journey south of Madrid into a long forgotten world as you discover the ancient city of Toledo, once the 
medieval capital of Spain. Become familiar with the life of a monk as you tour El Escorial Monastery, and 
spare some thought for the dead of the Spanish Civil War in the Valley of the Fallen - the history of this 
country will simply amaze you. 

Madrid by Night
At night, Spaniards put on their dancing shoes and step out for an evening of fun, feasting, and friendly 
flirting. After a panoramic drive to see the city lights, you'll join the locals at the Florida Park nightclub. 
Enjoy a fabulous tapas meal, a flamenco show, and all-night dancing.
